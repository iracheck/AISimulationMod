## CREATION GUIDE
## 6/19/25

Making a new faction in GangWarSandbox is as simple as this:

[Families]
Models=g_m_y_famca_01,g_m_y_famdnf_01,g_m_y_famfor_01
Tier4Model=ig_lamardavis

VehicleSet=GangVehicles

Tier1Weapons=WEAPON_PISTOL,WEAPON_MICROSMG
Tier2Weapons=WEAPON_MINISMG,WEAPON_PUMPSHOTGUN,WEAPON_SMG
Tier3Weapons=WEAPON_ASSAULTRIFLE

BaseHealth=300
AccuracyBonus=4
MaxSoldiers=23
TierUpgradeMultiplier=1.0



__ STEP 1 -- Create a file __
To create a faction, you must first be in the right directory (which if you found this file, you are)
Factions must ALWAYS be placed into: .../scripts/GangWarSandbox/Factions

If it is not placed here, it will not be seen by the mod's parser and thus will not be playable.

The naming of the file does not matter-- as long as the file type is a ".ini"

So, let's say we're making the Families, the gang that Franklin and Lamar are part of, we'd create a file with the path: .../scripts/GangWarSandbox/Factions/families.ini

One thing to note is that factions are only seperated by file for organization purposes-- if you want to share a list of factions with a friend, you can put them all in one file,
as long as each faction meets the format above!



__ STEP 2 -- Find ped and weapon models __

Provided are two links for peds and weapons:
https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/ped-models/#story
https://gtahash.ru/weapons

Note: Weapons must begin with the prefix "WEAPON_"



__ STEP 3 -- Fill out all the information __
Now that we have our ped models and the file is created, let's fill out how the faction looks and functions in the game world.

We'll go step by step and look at each line on the example located above. 

NAME TAG
> [Families]

As mentioned above, each faction needs a nametag. Without this, nothing below will be properly attributed to your faction!
Give it a memorable name, as this will be what appears in the game UI.

MODELS
> Models=g_m_y_famca_01,g_m_y_famdnf_01,g_m_y_famfor_01
> Tier4Model=ig_lamardavis

Models are what the peds in this faction look like. Paste the ped model names into there, always seperated by a comma.
The Tier 4 Model is the "juggernaut" that appears when the player joins the battle on a given team. Only one of these spawns at a time, so choose something memorable if possible!

VEHICLE SETS
> VehicleSet=GangVehicles

As one might guess, Vehicle Sets are the cars, tanks, and helicopters a faction has. Otherwise, just take any Nametag from the VehicleSets file, and it's plug and play.
NOTE: Like factions, the name of the file and the actual name of the VehicleSet in the mod are different. E.g. "Gang Vehicles" is actually GangVehicles.
But generally speaking, you can just remove the space inbetween and it will work fine!

WEAPONS
> Tier1Weapons=WEAPON_PISTOL,WEAPON_MICROSMG
> Tier2Weapons=WEAPON_MINISMG,WEAPON_PUMPSHOTGUN,WEAPON_SMG
> Tier3Weapons=WEAPON_ASSAULTRIFLE

This is very straightforward field. Ensure they are seperated by commas, and you always use the HASH of the vehicle. This will *always* start with "WEAPON_" as its prefix.

BASE HEALTH
> BaseHealth=100

This is the health of the Tier One unit. This value increases for other tiers-- for example, tier 2 gets 1.2X the health of a tier 1 ped. These are automatically clamped to avoid
too powerful of units, but keep in mind that anything over ~600 will be incredibly hard to kill.

ACCURACY
> AccuracyBonus=4

This is NOT the accuracy of the peds-- rather, its a additive value to that number. Let's say base accuracy for a ped is 10 (tier 1 accuracy), a bonus of 4 would make it 14. 
This is applied evenly to the higher tiers, so accuracy bonuses are much more beneficial for lower tier units.
Try to avoid putting this above 20 unless that faction has very small number of max soldiers. Values above 30 will result in juggernauts having near-perfect accuracy.

MAX SOLDIERS
> MaxSoldiers=23

Quite self explanatory, but max soldiers is the maximum number of LIVING peds at any point in time. This does not mean it will be constantly at this value--
peds only spawn with their squads, so if the squad size of any given faction is 4, but they have 17/20 peds alive, one more will need to die before the 4 respawn. 

UPGRADE MULTIPLIER
> TierUpgradeMultiplier=1.0

This is the chance of a troop upgrading a tier when it otherwise shouldn't. 1.0 means that it uses default upgrade behavior-- accepts numbers above and below 1.0.
This allows you to have factions that are "stronger" be somewhat nerfed, or buff otherwise weaker factions by making their troops artificially more likely to be strong-- even when 

Troop spawning is a 100 sided dice roll:
Values under 60 spawn a Tier 1,
Values under 90 spawn a Tier 2,
Values under 100 or Squad Leaders spawn a Tier 3

If you roll a dice roll of 53, with a multiplier of 1.2, you will get a rounded value of 64. This means that it will be a Tier 2 instead of a Tier 1. 
Use this to buff underpowered factions.

COMMENTS
> # This is a comment!

Comments are absolutely not necessary, but anything with a hashtag before it will be ignored by the parser. This means you can try different things out without deleting them,
or leave notes for the future.

Again, lines must BEGIN with a # for it to be ignored by the parser.

e.g.
TierUpgradeMultiplier = 1.0 # this is valid, and the comment doesn't make it unsafe!
# TierUpgradeMultiplier = 100.0 too big, but fun for testing!!



__ STEP 4 -- Balancing __

Of course, this step isn't necessary! However, balancing factions against others may be useful. You can note with the existing factions that I have a comment above listing "Tiers"

As a general rule, try to always keep a balance between the options! If BaseHealth is 600, that is a big number, so maybe the ped should have a smaller chance of upgrading itself.
If accuracy is high, maybe lower the number of soldiers.

This keeps factions competitive-- even Families vs Army, which realistically would be a bloodbath in favor of the Army, can be competitive if the Families use "swarm tactics" compared to the
army's smaller unit counts. However, without the player's help, the Families will still struggle greatly against the Army-- which is by design, but something you may want to consider.

>> Perfect balance does not equal fun! <<

That is why I tried to split my starting factions into tiers. I did not want the Army to lose to the Families, but I still wanted the fight to be possible.


__ END -- Common Mistakes __
If you are troubleshooting why it's not working, look here!!

1. The biggest mistake, first and foremost, is the file being the wrong type. The parser will ONLY look at any files with the ".ini" file type.
2. If the faction is missing data types, check "GWS.log" It will let you know if there are any required fields missing, although I haven't done too much worker on parser error logging.
